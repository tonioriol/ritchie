# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to agents when working with code in this repository.

- The canonical “why” / event logs for infrastructure changes live under `docs/feat/**/context.md` (example: [`docs/feat/k3-cluster-hetzner/context.md`](docs/feat/k3-cluster-hetzner/context.md:298)).
- Some older docs mention paths that don’t exist anymore (e.g. references to `k8s/` / `docker-compose.yml` in [`docs/feat/ritchie-migration/context.md`](docs/feat/ritchie-migration/context.md:17)); treat as historical notes.
