# TODOs

- [ ] Rename acestream to acestream-proxy in charts and docs.
- [ ] Add CI in addon repo to build/push `ghcr.io/tonioriol/acestreamio` with immutable tags.
- [ ] Install Argo CD Image Updater and configure it to auto-update the `acestreamio` Application without git commits.
- [ ] fix proxy, it doesnt work now at all for movistar (bad ace hashes?)
